        <h1>A big maze</h1>
        <p>
            A school is a maze<br>
            You feel like you are stuck in the same place<br>
            Maybe it will be in the end<br>
            No one there to let you out<br>
            Homework might seem like a long journey<br>
            Summer arrives with a kids cheering<br>
            Freedom is finally achieved<br>
